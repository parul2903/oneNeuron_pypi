The Python Package Index, abbreviated as PyPi, is the official repository of software
for the Python programming language.
It is a vast repository of open-source Python packages supplied by the worldwide community
of Python developers.

HOW TO CREATE OUR OWN PYTHON PACKAGE AND UPLOAD IT TO PyPi?
STEPS-
(1)
packaging_tutorial/
└── src/
    └── example_package/
        ├── __init__.py
        └── example.py

-> mkdir -p src/oneNeuron-> p: create parent directory if not exist (src)
-> touch src/oneNeuron/__init__.py (__init.py__)
-> touch src/oneNeuron/perceptron.py (example.py)

(2) Creating the Package files
packaging_tutorial/
├── LICENSE
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── setup.cfg
├── src/
│   └── example_package/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── example.py
└── tests/

-> pyproject.toml: touch pyproject.toml
A pyproject.toml file may be used to store configuration details other than 
build-related data 
It tells build tools (like pip and build) what is required to build your project.

build-system.requires gives a list of packages that are needed to build your 
package. Listing something here will only make it available during the build, not after it is installed.

build-system.build-backend is the name of Python object that will be used to 
perform the build. 

-> setup.py: touch setup.py
Basic details

(3) Creating Github Actions
./github/workflows/cicd.yml
This will create the folder: github, subfolder: workflows and file: cicd.yml
The above directory and file will be responsibe for pushing changes to pypi library
-> yml/yaml: yet another markup language
-> A YML file is a text document that contains data formatted using YAML, 
a human-readable data format used for data serialization. 
It is used for reading and writing data independent of a specific 
programming language.

WHAT ARE GITHUB ACTIONS?
Github Actions enables you to create custom software development lifecycle workflows
directly in your Github repository. These workflows are made out of different tasks
so-called actions that can be run automatically on certain events.

(4) Creating token
