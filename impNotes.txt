The Python Package Index, abbreviated as PyPi, is the official repository of software
for the Python programming language.
It is a vast repository of open-source Python packages supplied by the worldwide community
of Python developers.

HOW TO CREATE OUR OWN PYTHON PACKAGE AND UPLOAD IT TO PyPi?
STEPS-
(1)
packaging_tutorial/
└── src/
    └── example_package/
        ├── __init__.py
        └── example.py

-> mkdir -p src/oneNeuron-> p: create parent directory if not exist (src)
-> touch src/oneNeuron/__init__.py (__init.py__)
-> touch src/oneNeuron/perceptron.py (example.py)

(2) Creating the Package files
packaging_tutorial/

├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── setup.cfg
├── src/

│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── example.py
└── tests/

-> pyproject.toml: touch pyproject.toml
A pyproject.toml file may be used to store configuration details other than 
build-related data 
It tells build tools (like pip and build) what is required to build your project.

build-system.requires gives a list of packages that are needed to build your 
package. Listing something here will only make it available during the build, not after it is installed.

build-system.build-backend is the name of Python object that will be used to 
perform the build. 

-> setup.py: touch setup.py
Basic details
